## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

The goals of this project were:
 1. To use good quality semntic HTML to build the website.

 2. To use flexbox to create a three column structure that would grow and shrink appropriately when resizing the browser.

 3. To have the columns viewed below each other on mobile (hint: use flex-wrap and maybe min-width set to device width to see if I can achieve this).
